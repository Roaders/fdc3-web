## 0.6.0 (2025-10-07)

## Added:

`IOpenApplicationStrategy` now accepts the optional associated context object for window opening as params on the `canOpen` and `open` functions

## 0.5.0 (2025-10-03)

## Breaking:

`appDirectoryUrls` in `RootDesktopAgentFactoryParams` has been renamed to `appDirectoryEntries`:

```ts
new DesktopAgentFactory().createRoot({
    appDirectoryUrls: ['http://localhost:4299/v2/apps'],
}),
```

becomes:

```ts
new DesktopAgentFactory().createRoot({
    appDirectoryEntries: ['http://localhost:4299/v2/apps'],
}),
```

## Added:

Added for support for locally defined App Directories to eliminate the need to host an app directory on a server:

```ts
getAgent({
    failover: () =>
        new DesktopAgentFactory().createRoot({
            rootAppId: 'test-harness-root-app',
            appDirectoryEntries: [
                [
                    {
                        appId: 'local-app-id',
                        title: 'Local App',
                        url: 'https://example.com/someApp',
                    },
                ],
            ],
        }),
});
```

## 0.4.0 (2025-10-01)

Root app id is no longer resolved from the app directory but instead is passed in to the root app constructor:

```ts
getAgent({
    failover: () =>
        new DesktopAgentFactory().createRoot({
            rootAppId: 'test-harness-root-app' // can also pass a fully qualified id: test-harness-root-app@host.com
        }),
});
```

This makes it possible to run the container app without an app directory as this is no longer required to resolve the appId.

## 0.3.5 (2025-09-26)

Fixed generated package.json by removing incorrect module entry

## 0.3.4 (2025-08-08)

When handshake messages are not responded to by applications after 3 attempts that application is removed from the app resolver.
When an application is closed a WCP6Goodbye message is sent to the root agent and the application is removed from the app resolver.

## 0.3.3 (2025-08-04)

Fixed bugs around open strategies. Strategies that return `false` from `canOpen` are now correctly skipped and not used to open windows.

## 0.3.2 (2025-06-26)

 - Fixed a bug with `createRoot` that did not correctly pass the `identityUrl` to the `rootMessagePublisher`
 - Changed the `getAppDirectoryApplicationsImpl` to not append `/v2/apps` to app directory urls to allow non standard urls to be used

## 0.3.1 (2025-06-03)

Fixed a bug with `app-resolver.default` and `app-resolver.component` that did not automatically select an unqualified app id when there was only 1 suitable app available.
